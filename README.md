# Crypto_Clustering
------------------------------------

### Overview
------------

In this deliverable, we’ll be using our knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

For this project, we’ll be performing scaling values to z-scores, identifying optimal k from elbow curve, model fitting, performing PCA model, and comparing results to find the best model of fit.

### Resources
-------------

- 'Crypto_Clustering.ipynb' is our notebook the contains the analysis and visualizations.

- 'Resources' folder contains 'crypto_market_data.csv', which is the csv file where the data is derived from.
